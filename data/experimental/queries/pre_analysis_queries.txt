List all beam sections used in this model with their dimensions
Identify all columns with different section sizes and their grid locations
Count total number of structural elements by type: columns, beams, slabs.
List total number of load patterns.
Please give me all beam span lengths in the model, you can use beam point coordinate to get the span length and remember not to calculate the column
List all applied loads with magnitudes
List all column heights by story.
List all reinforcement bar sizes and grades used throughout the structure.
Count elements by floor level and provide totals for each story.
List all concrete materials with their compressive strengths.
Generate inventory of all concrete sections showing width, height, and reinforcement details
Please help me get the slab area of each story
List all grid line coordinates and spacings in X and Y directions
Create multiple beam section sizes, assign them to different spans based on length, then generate a section usage summary by floor
Generate a comprehensive report showing: all materials defined, which frame sections use each material, which objects use those sections, and total quantities by story.
List all beam sections that use more than 5 square inches of longitudinal top reinforcement.
Compare the total count of beams on Story 2 versus Story 3 and report which has more.
Count how many defined frame sections are I-sections versus rectangular sections.
Find the Cartesian coordinates for all points of slab
Identify the longest and shortest beam spans in the entire model and report their lengths and locations.
Find all slab panels with an aspect ratio (longer side / shorter side) greater than 2.0.
Find any beams that have more than one distributed load assigned to them under the same load pattern.
Find all concrete beam sections where the specified longitudinal rebar grade is not 'Grade 60'.
Retrieve all slab elements whose thickness is greater than 5 inches.
Generate a summary of all concrete materials, showing each material's name and its specified compressive strength
Verify that every story level has been defined as a 'Master Story' or is 'Similar To' another story and report any that are not.
Identify all beams with a span-to-depth ratio greater than 20, which may be susceptible to deflection issues.
Verify that all concrete frame objects use a material with a compressive strength of at least 4000 psi and flag any that do not.
Identify the story with the highest number of column elements.
Increase the thickness of all slab sections by 1 inch.
