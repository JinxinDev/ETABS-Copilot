Create rectangular area objects for floor slabs at story 2: 30'×40' slabs at coordinates (0,0) to (30,40), (30,0) to (60,40), (60,0) to (90,40), and (0,40) to (30,80), (30,40) to (60,80), (60,40) to (90,80). Assign 8-inch thick slab properties and apply 50 psf (0.05 ksf) live load
Create diaphragm based on story number
Create seismic load pattern EQ_X. Create mass source from DEAD load (multiplier 1.0) and LIVE load (multiplier 0.25).
Create a new concrete material with fc = 4.5 ksi, Ec = 4030 ksi, unit weight = 0.15 kcf. Then create three rectangular concrete sections: 18x24 inch columns, 14x30 inch beams, and 8-inch thick slabs. Assign the new concrete material to all sections and set rebar grades to Grade 60.
Create a 5-story building with Ground Floor at 0 ft, Levels 2-5 at 15 ft, 30 ft, 45 ft, and 60 ft elevations. Each story height is 15 ft. Create a cartesian grid system with 4 bays at 25 ft spacing in X-direction (Lines A-E) and 3 bays at 30 ft spacing in Y-direction (Lines 1-4).
Create load patterns: DEAD (Dead, 1.0 self-weight multiplier), LIVE (Live Load), WIND_X (Wind in X), WIND_Y (Wind in Y). Apply uniform dead load of 0.085 ksf and live load of 0.080 ksf to all floor slabs.
Create a new concrete material named 'C4000' with compressive strength 4.0 ksi, elastic modulus 3605 ksi, and unit weight 0.15 kip/ft³. Then create three rectangular concrete sections: '18x18COL' (18"×18"), '12x24BEAM' (12"×24"), and '16x20COL' (16"×20") all using this C4000 material. Create Grade 60 rebar material with yield strength 60 ksi and elastic modulus 29000 ksi. Then assign rebar reinforcement to the '18x18COL' section
Create a dead load pattern named 'DEAD' with self-weight multiplier 1.0. Apply 50 psf (0.05 ksf) uniform dead load to all slabs and 2.0 kip/ft distributed load on all beams. You have to differentiate beams and columns in frame objects
Create live load pattern 'LIVE' and apply 80 psf (0.08 ksf) to all floor slabs. Then create load pattern 'ROOF_LIVE' with 30 psf (0.03 ksf) for roof level slabs only.
Define a new user-defined concrete material named 'C6000' with a compressive strength of 6000 psi
Define a new rectangular concrete beam section, 14 inches wide by 28 inches deep, named 'B14x28', using 4000 psi concrete.
Modify the 'B14x28' section to have a depth of 30 inches and rename it to 'B14x30'.
Define three new stories, 'Lobby', 'Office1', and 'Office2', each with a height of 14 feet.
Draw columns using the 'C24x24' section at all grid intersections on the first floor.
Create a new strength design load combination named '1.2D+1.0L+0.5W' that includes Dead, Live, and Wind-X loads with their respective factors
For all stories above the Story1, change the section for columns only to 'W18x130'
For all stories below the 3rd floor, increase the section depth of all concrete frames by 4 inches.
Increase all uniform loads applied to slabs on the Story2 by 15%.
Find all beams that are shorter than 10 feet and change their section property to 'B12x20'.
Standardize all concrete frame section names to follow the format 'CB_DepthxWidth', for example, 'B14x28' should become 'CB_28x14'.
For any story with a height greater than 15 feet, replace all column sections on that story with 'C24x24'. Remember to differentiate column and beam in frame
On the 3rd floor only, remove all beams that are oriented in the Y-direction.
For every slab in the model, change its section property to 'S10'
For Story2, Story4, and Story5, increase the story height by 1.5 feet.
