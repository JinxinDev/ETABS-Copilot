1. Create a rectangular grid with four lines (A-D) in the X-direction at 20-foot spacing and five lines (1-5) in the Y-direction at 20-foot spacing. Story 1 has 15-foot height; stories 2-5 have 12-foot heights.
2. Define concrete material CONC with 4,000 psi strength. Define rebar material REBAR as Grade 60 with 60 ksi yield strength. Create column sections: C20X20 (20"×20"), C18X18 (18"×18"), C24X24 (24"×24"), and C20X20 (20"×20"). Create beam section B12X24 (12"×24"). Create slab section SLAB5 as 5-inch shell-thin element.
3.1 Draw columns at all grid intersections for each story. Grid intersections are located at coordinates: A-1 (0,0), A-2 (0,20), A-3 (0,40), A-4 (0,60), A-5 (0,80), B-1 (20,0), B-2 (20,20), B-3 (20,40), B-4 (20,60), B-5 (20,80), C-1 (40,0), C-2 (40,20), C-3 (40,40), C-4 (40,60), C-5 (40,80), D-1 (60,0), D-2 (60,20), D-3 (60,40), D-4 (60,60), and D-5 (60,80).For stories 1-3, assign section C20X20 to exterior columns at A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, A-5, D-1, D-2, D-3, D-4, D-5, B-1, B-5, C-1, and C-5. Assign section C24X24 to interior columns at B-2, B-3, B-4, C-2, C-3, and C-4. For stories 4-5, assign section C18X18 to the same exterior column locations and C20X20 to the same interior column locations. The sections are already developed.
3.2 Draw beams at each story. Along grid lines 1 through 5 (Y = 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 feet). Along grid lines A through D (X = 0, 20, 40, 60 feet). Assign existing section B12X24 to all beams.
3.3 Draw rectangular slab. The bays per floor have corner coordinates: A1-B2 (0,0 to 20,20), A2-B3 (0,20 to 20,40), A3-B4 (0,40 to 20,60), A4-B5 (0,60 to 20,80), B1-C2 (20,0 to 40,20), B2-C3 (20,20 to 40,40), B3-C4 (20,40 to 40,60), B4-C5 (20,60 to 40,80), C1-D2 (40,0 to 60,20), C2-D3 (40,20 to 60,40), C3-D4 (40,40 to 60,60), and C4-D5 (40,60 to 60,80). Create these slabs on stories 2-5 and the roof level. Assign existing SLAB5 to all slabs.
4. Set all joints in base level as fixed. Assign rigid diaphragm at each story.
5. Apply superimposed dead load of 25 psf on floor slabs at stories 2, 3, and 4. Apply superimposed dead load of 20 psf on the story5. Apply live load of 50 psf on floor slabs at stories 2, 3, and 4. Apply live load of 20 psf on the story 5.
6. Generate ASCE 7 combinations: 1.4SD; 1.2SD+1.6LL; 1.2SD+1.0LL; 0.9SD.
