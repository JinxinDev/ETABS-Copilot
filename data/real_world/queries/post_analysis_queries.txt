1. For all beams on stories 2 through 5, extract and create a table showing: beam label, story level, start point coordinates, end point coordinates, maximum positive moment with its value and governing load combination, maximum negative moment with its value and governing load combination, and beam length. Sort the results by story level then by maximum absolute moment in descending order.
2. For all columns on story 1, extract axial forces under all four load combinations. For each column, calculate and report: column label, grid location, mean axial force across all combinations, maximum axial force with governing combination, minimum axial force with governing combination, standard deviation of axial forces, and the range between maximum and minimum. Identify the three columns with highest mean axial loads.
3. Identify all beams that satisfy ALL of the following conditions: beam length greater than 10 feet AND maximum moment (absolute value, any combination) exceeds 50 kip-ft AND located on stories 3 or 4. For beams meeting these criteria, report: beam label, story, length, maximum moment value, and which load combination governs.
